    "**P**ython **O**ptimization **M**odeling **O**bjects or **Pyomo** is an optimization package with high level language (inherited from Python) designed for modeling and optimizing formulated problems tackled in a wide range of scientific fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of Pyomo is an object oriented capability for representing optimization models. This means each model is an object with its own attributes such as Sets, Variables and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyomo Supports formulation of common optimization models. Type of problems that this package can formulate and solve are but not limited to:\n",
    "1. Linear programs (**LP**)\n",
    "2. Mixed-integer programs (**MIP**)\n",
    "3. Non-linear programs (**NLP**)\n",
    "4. Mixed-integer non-linear programs (**MINLP**)\n",
    "5. Mathematical problems with equilibrium constraints (**MPECs**)\n",
    "6. Constraints and objectives based on differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "And more\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyomo is a modeling language yet it hosts a *CLI* containing solver packages allowing the user to interact with solver results. To name a few:\n",
    "1. CBC\n",
    "2. CPLEX\n",
    "3. Gurobi\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyomo is an **ALM** or an **A**lgebraic **M**odeling **L**anguage. ALMs are high-level languages fir describing and solving optimization problems. Just like GAMS we use Pyomo to model a problem for the hosted solvers to solve and optimize. What separates this ALM from the other available options is its Pythonic nature, meaning integration to any code written in python and the open-source capabilities that python provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<div align=center> Why do we need an ALM?</div>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a language to specify optimization models, the process of writing input files, executing a solver, and extracting resolves from a solver is tedious and error-prone. On the solver side of optimization applications, we can have different acceptable input structures per solver while there is no real standard that these solvers adhere to. Troubleshooting communication problems arising from mis-input between the model and solver is nearly impossible without a high-level language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyomo as an package extends Python to include objects for optimization modeling, these high-level objects are then translated to low-level languages (code) that can be processed by external solvers. Using Pyomo allows us to use Python features like concurrency by leveraging packages such as **Multi-processing** and **Asyncio**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In every optimization problem we need a grade of simplification which allow us to represent our *knowledge* in a structured way. This simplification help us to answer the following questions with less uncertainty:\n",
    "1. What the system is?\n",
    "2. What is the future state of our system?\n",
    "3. What are the key factors (our knowledge in form of parameters) of the system?\n",
    "4. How did we model the system? was it in a worst case scenario?\n",
    "\n",
    "So a key aspect of a model to know before formulation is the required level of detail that we want to implement. To do so in formulations we have 3 main key concepts to make process of formulations as universal as possible:\n",
    "1. Variables: These represent the unknown or the changing parts of the model\n",
    "2. Parameters: Symbolic representation of real data, mostly the same during one instance of our model\n",
    "3. Relations: Equations such as *constraints*, *bounds* and *objective functions* that are either linear or non-linear combinations of Variables and Parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "These relations can be taxing if the relations are mostly non-linear and complex so a lot of modelers seek to use linear relations as possible or opt to using linear approximations of the non-linear functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets review some very simple optimization problems\n",

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude Chapter 1 we will go over the reasons why Pyomo can be a good choice as your primary ALM whether you are a student or a researcher:\n",
    "1. **Python:** An understandable high-level syntax and integration possibilities through the usage of a platera of packages.\n",
    "2. **Customizable Capacity:** Pyomo has a framework plug-in that allows users to add the functionalities they want without destablizing the core functions.\n",
    "3. **Command-Line Tools and Scripting:** Alongside scripting capabilities in your IDE or environment of choice pyomo is accessible through a CLI by just using `pyomo` command in your terminal of choice.\n",
    "4. **Concrete and Abstract model definitions:** This allow user to define the model in two different ways dependent to the context. Both types can be initialized with various ways and through different file formats.\n",
    "5. **Object-Oriebted Design:** Models are Python objects and the component of each model is defined as an attribute of the model object. This approach can help us seperate components of the same name through their model name. This models can have nested heirarchy through blocks which we tackle in the following chapters.\n",
    "6. **Expressive modeling capability:** We can solve a wide range of optimization problems with the model created by Pyomo.\n",
    "7. **Solver Integration:** There is 2 ways to use solvers with models whether through tightly coupled (linking to optimization solver libraries such as Gurobi or CPLEX that do not require external file creation) or loosely coupled (through system calls).\n",
    "8. **Open Source:** The project is open source under the BSD license and carefully managed.\n",

    "In this section we will learn about Pyomo components and model capabilities. A model which is an object has components that allow us to create our desired formulation. These components consist of variable, objective functions, constraints, index sets and parameters which are present in most AMLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the previous chapter, solving any problem with Pyomo consists of 3 main steps:\n",
    "1. Create an instance of a model using Pyomo modeling components\n",
    "2. Pass this instance to solver to find a solution\n",
    "3. Report and analyze results from the solver\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the Pythonic nature of Pyomo to create custom workflows that require optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the warehouse location problem in this chapter in order to take a deeper look at Pyomo *components*. The formulation for warehouse location problem is as followed. This problem seeks to find the optimal positioning of the warehouse in order to satisfy the most demand with optimizing transportation costs.\n",
